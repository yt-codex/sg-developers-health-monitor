      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>This dashboard consolidates three signal layers—macroeconomic headwinds, developer balance-sheet and liquidity indicators, and news-based event flags—to monitor vulnerability among Singapore-listed property developers.</p>
        <p>Use it as a workflow: Macro sets the operating backdrop (rates, credit, costs, demand proxies); Developer News surfaces potential stress signals from headlines and summaries using rule-based risk tags; Listed Developers translates key financial and operating drivers into a transparent health score, with the specific drivers shown alongside the score so you can see what is pushing a firm toward green/amber/red.</p>
        <p>Caveats: this is for informational monitoring, not investment advice. Outputs are only as reliable as the underlying data and update frequency, and rule-based tagging can miss context or nuance. Validate any conclusions against primary disclosures (announcements, financial statements) and audited filings.</p>
